# Outrun Hell (Beta 1.0)
Welcome to the beta release of Outrun Hell, a text based adventure game!
You will notice a distinct lack of world building, and the game itself will feel quick.
This game is still under development from the story side.
However, most of the game mechanics have been implemented. The game is playable!

To start a game, open the OutrunHell.java file and press the green play button on line 5.
Best of luck, adventurer!
